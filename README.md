# Health Insurance Fraud Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook designed to detect and analyze potential fraud in health insurance claims. The notebook leverages machine learning techniques to identify suspicious patterns in healthcare data, specifically targeting fraudulent claims.

## Contents

- **HealthInsurancefraud_detection.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook that contains all the code, data analysis, and model-building steps for detecting health insurance fraud.
  
## Datasets

The notebook uses the following datasets:

- **combined_beneficiary.csv**: Information about the beneficiaries, including demographics and other relevant details.
- **combined_data.csv**: Aggregated data related to claims and services.
- **combined_inpatient.csv**: Data specific to inpatient services, such as admission and discharge records.
- **combined_outpatient.csv**: Details of outpatient services, including visit records and procedures.

Open the `HealthInsurancefraud_detection.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter. The notebook is organized into sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the datasets and explore the data to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, including handling missing values and data transformations.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may help in fraud detection.
4. **Model Building**: Train machine learning models to identify potential fraud in the insurance claims.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models and fine-tune them for better accuracy.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and suggest next steps or improvements.
